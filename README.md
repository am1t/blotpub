# Micropub for [Blot](https://blot.im), with Dropbox

An endpoint that accepts [Micropub](http://micropub.net/) requests, creates a simple Blot posts and saves them to a configured Dropbox folder. This enables updating a Blot blog through a [Micropub client](https://indieweb.org/Micropub/Clients).

### _Early alpha release_
Supported:
* Creation of posts with or without titles
* Metadata creation for tags, slugs and published date
* Support for [like](https://indieweb.org/like) and [reply](https://indieweb.org/reply) post types. Added as metadata `like-of` and `in-reply-to`.

Unsupported:
* Media handling, image files
* Replacing an existing post with a new version

## Requirements
Requires at least Node.js 6.0.0.

## Installation
This is a self-hosteable Micropub endpoint. Install it as a normal Node.js application. Add the required [configuration](#configuration) values via environment variables or similar mechanism. 

You can also deploy directly to Heroku.

## Endpoint discovery
Once you have deployed the application, your Micropub endpoint can be found at `/micropub` e.g. `https://example.com/micropub`.

To enable automatic discovery for your [Micropub endpoint](https://indieweb.org/micropub#Endpoint_Discovery) and [token endpoint](https://indieweb.org/obtaining-an-access-token#Discovery), you will need to add the following values to your Blot site's `<head>` - regularly in the `head.html` file in your theme.

```
<link rel="micropub" href="https://example.com/micropub">
<link rel="token_endpoint" href="https://tokens.indieauth.com/token">
```

## Configuration
### Required values
The following variables are required to enable a Micropub client to push content to your GitHub repository.
