# Micropub for [Blot](https://blot.im), with Dropbox

An endpoint that accepts [Micropub](http://micropub.net/) requests, creates a simple Blot posts and saves them to a configured Dropbox folder. This enables updating a Blot blog through a [Micropub client](https://indieweb.org/Micropub/Clients).

Currently, the endpoint supports the following.

* Creation of posts with titles ([articles](https://indieweb.org/article)) and without titles ([notes](https://indieweb.org/note))
* Metadata creation for tags, slugs and published date
* Support for [like](https://indieweb.org/like) and [reply](https://indieweb.org/reply) post types. Added as metadata `like-of` and `in-reply-to`.
* Uploading of image files as `multipart` data. Added as metadata `photo`

## TODO
* [ ] Implement repost, bookmark post types
* [ ] Add support for media endpoint
* [ ] Add support for updating and deleting the posts

## Requirements
Requires at least Node.js 6.0.0.

## Installation
This is a self-hosteable Micropub endpoint. Install it as a normal Node.js application. Add the required [configuration](#configuration) values via environment variables or similar mechanism. 

You can also deploy directly to Heroku.

**Note**: This is an alpha release and there may be some edge cases that aren't handled. If you find one, please [report an issue](https://github.com/am1t/blotpub/issues/new).

## Endpoint discovery
Once you have deployed the application, your Micropub endpoint can be found at `/micropub` e.g. `https://example.com/micropub`.

To enable automatic discovery for your [Micropub endpoint](https://indieweb.org/micropub#Endpoint_Discovery) and [token endpoint](https://indieweb.org/obtaining-an-access-token#Discovery), you will need to add the following values to your Blot site's `<head>` - regularly in the `head.html` file in your theme.

```
<link rel="micropub" href="https://example.com/micropub">
<link rel="token_endpoint" href="https://tokens.indieauth.com/token">
```

## Configuration
