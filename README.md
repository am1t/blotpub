# Micropub for [Blot](https://blot.im), with Dropbox
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/am1t/blotpub.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/am1t/blotpub) [![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.io/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fam1t%2Fblotpub.svg?type=shield)](https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fam1t%2Fblotpub?ref=badge_shield)

An endpoint that accepts [Micropub](http://micropub.net/) requests, creates a simple Blot posts and saves them to a configured Dropbox folder. This enables updating a Blot blog through a [Micropub client](https://indieweb.org/Micropub/Clients).

Currently, the endpoint supports the following.

* Creation of posts with titles ([articles](https://indieweb.org/article)) and without titles ([notes](https://indieweb.org/note))
* Metadata creation for tags, slugs and published date
* Support for [like](https://indieweb.org/like) and [reply](https://indieweb.org/reply) post types. Added as metadata `like-of` and `in-reply-to`
* Uploading of image files as `multipart` data. Added as metadata `photo`
* Support for syndicating posts to Mastodon. Added as metadata `mastodon-link`
* In-built media endpoint available at `/micropub/media`

A step-by-step setup guide is available at [the introduction blog post](https://blog.amitgawande.com/micropub-endpoint-for-blot). [Full implementation report](https://micropub.rocks/implementation-reports/servers/265/WkpcEN4FhqpE4HN6La7E) is available on [micropub.rocks](https://micropub.rocks/)

## TODO
* [x] Add support for media endpoint
* [ ] Implement repost, bookmark post types
* [ ] Add support for updating and deleting the posts

## Requirements
Requires at least Node.js 6.0.0.

## Installation
This is a self-hosteable Micropub endpoint. Install it as a normal Node.js application. Add the required [configuration](#configuration) values via environment variables or similar mechanism. 

You can also deploy directly to Heroku.

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/am1t/blotpub)

**Note**: This is an alpha release and there may be some edge cases that aren't handled. If you find one, please [report an issue](https://github.com/am1t/blotpub/issues/new).

## Endpoint discovery
Once you have deployed the application, your Micropub endpoint can be found at `/micropub` e.g. `https://deployed-blotpub-app.com/micropub`. Note that the endpoint url is different from your website url. It would be the url for the blotpub application that your installed in the 1st step. For Heroku deployment, it would be something like `https://*****. herokuapp.com/micropub` (exact url will be available at Heroku dashboard).

To enable automatic discovery for your [Micropub endpoint](https://indieweb.org/micropub#Endpoint_Discovery) and [token endpoint](https://indieweb.org/obtaining-an-access-token#Discovery), you will need to add the following values to your Blot site's `<head>` - regularly in the `head.html` file in your theme.

```
<link rel="micropub" href="https://deployed-blotpub-app.com/micropub">
<link rel="token_endpoint" href="https://tokens.indieauth.com/token">
```
